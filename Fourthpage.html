	  <h2><i>Q2: How do you get there?</i></h2>
	  <p>You will need 2 full days to reach the summit and descend. On day one, you depart from the village of Imlil in the morning and hike about 5-6 hours to the refuge where you will  spend the night. Then on day 2, you'll wake up before sunrise to hike the 4 hours to the summit, then head back down to the refuge, and all the way back to Imlil. <b>Reaching the summit of Toubkal is no easy feat:</b>the hike is physically challenging, the changes in altitude are rapid, and parts of the trail are not well maintained.</p> 
		<h2><i>Q3: How many try to climb it every year?</i></h2>
		<p>The best time to climb Mount Toubkal is in the spring(April or May) or the autumn(September or october). Climbing Mount Toubkal in the summer is difficult due to the heat(June, July and August). Climbing Mount Toubkal in the winter is much more dangerous due to the snow and ice(November, December, January, February and March).</p>
