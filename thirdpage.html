	  <h2><i>Q2: How do you get there?</i></h2>
	  <p>The Majority of climbers on Denali attempt the<b> Western Buttress route,</b>which is considered the least technical way to get the summit. The Muldrow Glacier on the north side of the mountain is similar with regard to trchnical difficulty and length, but is far more committing and involved as you begin the climb by hiking in rather than flying to a base camp. The average expedition is 17 to 21 days, round trip. It is possible to reach the summit on day 12 or 13. If you do not mind colder temperature, then early season( late April to early May) tends to have more high pressure days. As temperature warm up in june, clouds become more common and bring preciptation higher on the mountain. </p> 
		<h2><i>Q3: How many try to climb it every year?</i></h2>
		<p>There is a limit of 1,500 climbers on Denali from April 1 to August 1. There is not a daily or weekly limit, only seasonal limit.</p>
		<h2><i>Q4: I want to climb Denali someday. Can anyone do it?</i></h2>
		<p>Ideally, you will need to experience climbing up to 20,000 feet in order to understand how your body behaves under conditions of extremely thin air. If you aren't used to dealing with high-altitude sickness, then at some point, your body may simply stop working properly. Having an experiance of winter camping is also very desirable, because on Denali you will have to face the same exact cold encountered by climbers at 8000m in the Himalayas.</p>
		<h2><i>Q5: How much does it cost?</i></h2>
		<p>Climbers are required to pay the full permit fee when they submit the regitration form. The cost of a mountaineering permit for the 2021 season(January 1,2021 through December 31,2021) is $375 US currency(70,000LKR). Climbers who are 24 years old or younger at the time their expedition begins are eligible for a $275(51,000LKR) youth fee. It is also important to be aware that teams must also pay a park entrance fee of $15 per person.</p>
